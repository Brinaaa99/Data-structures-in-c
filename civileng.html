<p><h4>The Department of Civil Engineering of Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology has been functioning since 2013. Initially the Department was affiliated to Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam. Currently, the department offers a four year B.Tech programme under the affiliation of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) . The Department has a sanctioned intake of 60 students under the programme. The Department has grown tremendously over the past eleven years and have eight batches of students who have graduated from the Department. This is a professionally run department, focusing on an education system that emphasizes deep learning of the fundamentals, research and entrepreneurship to contribute to society and environment. The Department is accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for the academic years 2024-25, 2025-26 and 2026-27.

Apart from academic courses, the department provides various add-on courses, hands-on training of software, industry incorporated expert talks, seminars and workshops to students as well as the faculty.  The department has signed MoUs with various recognized institutions like KKM Soft, which can enhance the knowledge and original thinking of students.  

As a never old discipline of engineering, the graduates from the department have a wide choice of career opportunities, right after their course. The students from the department have been placed in core companies like Dalmia Cements, as part of campus placements. Apart from the private companies, the job opportunities in public sector jobs, like Railways, SAIL, NTPC, BPCL, PWD etc. are higher when compared to other streams engineering. 

The department is backed up by faculty who have completed their post graduations and PhDs from elite institutions like IITs and NITs. The department has well equipped laboratories and computing facilities to aid the students and faculties in research work and consultancy services.
